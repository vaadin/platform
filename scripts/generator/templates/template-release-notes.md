# Getting Started with Vaadin
## App starters
The best way to get started with Vaadin is to go to [https://start.vaadin.com](https://start.vaadin.com) and configure your new application by setting up your views, entities, styles, and the technology stack youâ€™re interested in. 

### Note
Vaadin 22 starters are not available just yet in vaadin.com. You can use Vaadin 21 starter and manually change Vaadin version (see instructions below).

## Maven Archetypes
Maven is the de-facto build tool for Java web applications. Major IDEs also support Maven out of the box and most often you'll be using Maven via your favorite IDE.
There are currently two Maven archetypes available, the `vaadin-archetype-application` which corresponds to the project base for Flow and the corresponding `vaadin-archetype-spring-application` if you prefer use Flow with [Spring](https://spring.io/).
The version of the archetype should match the platform version. After you have Maven installed, you can quickly create and run a Vaadin app with the following command:

```
mvn -B archetype:generate \
                -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin \
                -DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-application \
                -DarchetypeVersion={{platform}}\
                -DgroupId=org.test \
                -DartifactId=vaadin-app \
                -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
                && cd vaadin-app \
                && mvn package jetty:run
```

```
mvn -B archetype:generate \
                -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin \
                -DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-spring-application \
                -DarchetypeVersion={{platform}}\
                -DgroupId=org.test \
                -DartifactId=vaadin-app \
                -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
                && cd vaadin-app \
                && mvn
```

## Manually changing Vaadin version for Java projects

Add the following dependency to dependencyManagement in pom.xml.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
    <version>{{platform}}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Known Issues and Limitations

## Flow
- The Template-in-Template feature has [some limitations](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atemplate-in-template+)
- Links matching the context do not result in browser page load by default, instead they are handled with application routing. To opt-out, set the `router-ignore` attribute on the anchor element. This opt-out is needed for cases when native browser navigation is necessary, e. g., when [using `Anchor` to link a `StreamResource` download](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/7623).

## OSGi support
OSGi does not work in V15.
