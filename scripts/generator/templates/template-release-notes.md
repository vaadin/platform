## New and Noteworthy

Here are the highlighted new and improved features in Vaadin 15. To see the full list of bug fixes and improvements, check Included Projects and Change Log.

### Vaadin for TypeScript
In Vaadin 15 we introduce Vaadin for TypeScript as an alternative to Java;  
When creating applications with Vaadin, developers can choose to write client-side code in TypeScript so that they can stay close to the target platform (the browser), it is easy to use any of the native Web platform features directly (including Service Workers and offline support), and the code is automatically type-checked. Vaadin 15 also provides a type-safe and secure way to access data from backend. See quick start guide from [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/docs/v15/flow/typescript/quick-start-guide.html)

### Client-side Router
Vaadin 15 includes Vaadin Router, the client-side router for Web Components.Vaadin Router is in use by default for all apps. See more from [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/router).

### Faster and more reliable frontend dependency management by using pnpm
Faster and more reliable builds when updating the platform version. Biggest effect is when there are frontend dependency changes and when multiple projects/modules are updated. Vaadin 15 has npm in use by default and pnpm can be taken into use optionally. See instructions from [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/docs/v15/flow/advanced/tutorial-switch-npm-pnpm.html).

# Getting Started with Vaadin
## App starters
The best way to get started with Vaadin is to go to [https://vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) and pick an app template for the technology stack youâ€™re interested in. 

## Maven Archetypes

Maven is the de-facto build tool for Java web applications. Major IDEs also support Maven out of the box and most often you'll be using Maven via your favorite IDE. There is currently one Maven archetype available, the `vaadin-archetype-application` which corresponds to the project base for Flow. The version of the archetype should match the platform version. After you have Maven installed, you can quickly create and run a Vaadin app with the following command:

```
mvn -B archetype:generate \
                -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin \
                -DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-application \
                -DarchetypeVersion={{platform}}\
                -DgroupId=org.test \
                -DartifactId=vaadin-app \
                -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
                && cd vaadin-app \
                && mvn package jetty:run
```

## Manually changing Vaadin version for Java projects

Add the following dependency to dependencyManagement in pom.xml.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
    <version>{{platform}}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Known Issues and Limitations

## Flow
- The Template-in-Template feature has [some limitations](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atemplate-in-template+)
- There are [some issues](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/5146) in using Web Sockets as the Push channel in certain OSGi environments, but long polling works.
- Links matching the context do not result in browser page load by default, instead they are handled with application routing. To opt-out, set the `router-ignore` attribute on the anchor element. This opt-out is needed for cases when native browser navigation is necessary, e. g., when [using `Anchor` to link a `StreamResource` download](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/7623).

## Vaadin Gradle Plugin
- Vaadin Gradle Plugin does not currently work with Vaadin 15.

## OSGi support
OSGi does not work in V15.

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
