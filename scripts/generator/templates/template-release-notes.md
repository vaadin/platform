### App Starters
All app starters are available at https://vaadin.com/start

# Getting Started with Vaadin 12
The best way to get started with Vaadin 12 is to go to https://vaadin.com/start and pick an app template for the technology stack youâ€™re interested in. There are two types of app templates available.

The **Project Bases** are for starting your project from scratch with only the necessary dependencies and a couple of placeholder files available.

There are also full application examples available like **Bakery (Pro)** and **Beverage Buddy**. Those show you some opinionated examples on how to build different types of applications, with optionally integrating to a backend.

### Getting Started Manually

For **frontend projects** you can get the dependencies with 
 - [Bower](https://bower.io) by running `bower install vaadin` or `bower install vaadin-core`
 - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) by running `npm install @vaadin/vaadin` or `npm install @vaadin/vaadin-core`

For **Java projects**, an example of the necessary setup can be found from the [Project Base](https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-flow/blob/1.0.0/pom.xml#L24..L73).

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
6) If you encounter issues with code or the UI in any of the app starters, the corresponding repositories are:
  a) https://github.com/vaadin/bakery-app-starter-issues for Bakery
