# Known Issues and Limitations

This is the prerelease version of Vaadin 14.x for evaluating a number of new features and bug fixes. The API in this prerelease version is not considered final and may change based on user feedback.

## OSGi support
- OSGi feature is not supported under `npm mode` for the current Vaadin 14 versions, we are looking forward to fixing this in a near future. 

## Flow
- The Template-in-Template feature has [some limitations](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atemplate-in-template+)
- There are [some issues](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/5146) in using Web Sockets as the Push channel in certain OSGi environments, but long polling works.

## Components
- The dark theme preset does not work in IE11 when applied to the `<html>` element.

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) Bug tickets and enhancement requests that are specific to a certain Vaadin component should be posted in the component's Web Component repostory (e.g. https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button for Button).
2) Issues that are not component-specific (e.g. requests for new components) or encompass multiple components should be posted in [vaadin-flow-components](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-flow-components) repository. 
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
