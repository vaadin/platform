## New and Noteworthy

Here are the highlighted new and improved features in Vaadin 16. To see the full list of bug fixes and improvements, check Included Projects and Change Log.

### Automatic `Node` installation
- Available from Vaadin versions 16
- If no global or local Node installation is found Node will be automatically installed to `~/.vaadin`
  - Only requires the first project to install as later can use the same installation
  - No need to have Node installed for CI
- Uses proxy data from 
  - System properties
  - {project}/.npmrc
  - ~/.npmrc
  - Environment variables
### `pnpm` is the default frontend package manager
- Now pnpm is used by default instead of npm
  - npm was still default in Vaadin 14.2 and 15
- No migration needed - pnpm is installed once to /.vaadin inside home folder. See [differences here](https://github.com/vaadin/flow-and-components-documentation/blob/V14-next/documentation/advanced/tutorial-switch-npm-pnpm.asciidoc) for more information about what has changed

### `Devmode` is run as a separate thread to speed up server startup
- Allows server to continue startup parallel to Flow development mode process which runs pnpm/npm and webpack build
- The browser shows a white page that is automatically refreshed to open app once devmode process has finished
- As server is started up faster, there is no timeout from "run from IDE" or from server plugins

### RTL Language Support

All components have full support for right-to-left languages (e.g. arabic, hebrew) so that they render correctly when the UI is in RTL mode.

### Hierarchy column renderer 
Component renderer can be used in TreeGrid hierarchy column.

### Grid hidden columns performance fix
Hidden columns are no longer rendered to the DOM, which improves Grid/TreeGrid/GridPro performance with a large number of hidden columns.

# Getting Started with Vaadin
## App starters
The best way to get started with Vaadin is to go to [https://vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) and pick an app template for the technology stack youâ€™re interested in. 

### Note
Vaadin 16 starters are not available just yet in vaadin.com. You can use Vaadin 14 starter and manually change Vaadin version (see instructions below).

## Manually changing Vaadin version for Java projects

Add the following contents to your project pom.xml.
```
<dependencyManagement>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
        <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
        <version>{{platform}}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencyManagement>

# Known Issues and Limitations

This is the prerelease version of Vaadin 16 for evaluating a number of new features and bug fixes. The API in this prerelease version is not considered final and may change based on user feedback.

## Flow
- The Template-in-Template feature has [some limitations](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atemplate-in-template+)
- Links matching the context do not result in browser page load by default, instead they are handled with application routing. To opt-out, set the `router-ignore` attribute on the anchor element. This opt-out is needed for cases when native browser navigation is necessary, e. g., when [using `Anchor` to link a `StreamResource` download](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/7623).

# Migrating from Vaadin 8
See [the migration guide](https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/migration/1-migrating-v8-v10.html)

# Migrating from Vaadin 10-14
See [the migration guide](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/v14-migration/v14-migration-guide.html)

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
