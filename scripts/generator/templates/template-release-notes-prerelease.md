# Vaadin {{platform}}

Vaadin consists of a set of web components, a Java web framework, configurable themes, tools and a set of app templates.

With every major release, we will change and improve things based on your feedback. This may lead to breaking changes, which will be listed for each part of the platform in the breaking changes section.

Visit [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/) to get started.

## Support
Vaadin 14 is an LTS (long term support) version, which will be supported for 5 years after the GA (general availability) release. More details of our release model are available on our [roadmap page](https://vaadin.com/roadmap).

Vaadin also provides [commercial support and warranty](https://vaadin.com/support).

## New and Noteworthy

Here are the highlighted new and improved features in Vaadin 14. To see the full list of bug fixes and improvements, check Included Projects and Change Log.

### npm support
Using Bower for frontend dependencies is currently discouraged (by the author), and npm has become the defacto standard. In Vaadin 14 npm is used as the front-end package manager.

- Embedding Flow application is now possible by exporting it as a web component.
- When executing JavaScript from the server-side Java, it is possible to get the return value of the execution to the server-side using Page.executeJs(String expression, Serializable... parameters)
- It is possible to obtain details like screen width & height and time zone on the server-side using Page.retrieveExtendedClientDetails( ExtendedClientDetailsReceiver receiver)
- Simplified styling of application and component with @CssImport

### Components

- Grid columns auto-width

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
