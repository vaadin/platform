# Vaadin {{platform}}

Vaadin consists of a set of web components, a Java web framework, configurable themes, tools and a set of app templates.

With every major release, we will change and improve things based on your feedback. This may lead to breaking changes, which will be listed for each part of the platform in the breaking changes section.

Visit [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/) to get started.

## Support
Vaadin 15 is supported for one month after Vaadin 16 has been released. The latest LTS (long term support) version is Vaadin 14. More details of our release model are available on our [roadmap page](https://vaadin.com/roadmap).

Vaadin also provides [commercial support and warranty](https://vaadin.com/support).

## New and Noteworthy

Here are the highlighted new and improved features in Vaadin 15. To see the full list of bug fixes and improvements, check Included Projects and Change Log.

### Vaadin for TypeScript
In Vaadin 15 we introduce Vaadin for TypeScript (MVP);  
When creating applications with Vaadin developers can write client-side code in TypeScript so that they can stay close to the target platform (the browser), it is easy to use any of the native Web platform features directly (including Service Workers and offline support), and the code is automatically type-checked.

### Client-side Router
Vaadin 15 includes Vaadin Router, the client-side router for Web Components.

### npm support
In Vaadin 15 npm is used as the front-end package manager. Bower (compatibility mode) support has been dropped from Vaadin 15.
Bower (compatibility mode) and WebJars are still fully supported in Vaadin 14 (LTS).

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
