## New and Noteworthy Since Vaadin 16

Here are the highlighted new and improved features in vaadin 17. To see the full list of bug fixes and improvements, check Included Projects and Change Log.

### Framework
#### Features
- A new client forms API for TypeScript (TS) views
  - New Binder API to associate a UI Field with a Model property.
  - Java Generator now produces Form Models for TS to make easy bind it to the UI elments.
  - Bean Validators in client side able to reuse Java Bean annotations, and to add custom validations
- Live Reload in browser
- Support for Url template

#### Breaking changes
- Removed the PWA install popup. Because `beforeInstallPrompt` was removed from browsers specs
- Throwing instead of Warning when configuration annotations like `@Push` or `@BodySize` are not in the `AppShell`class

### Components
#### TypeScript definitions for all components
In Vaadin 17, Vaadin components come with TypeScript definitions helping to use web components in TypeScript views. Depending on the IDE you use, TypeScript definitions can also give additional benefits like better code completion and auto import.

#### New features with Vaadin Charts
- Add new Java styling APIs
- Support 4 new chart types (Org Chart, Timeline, X-Range, Bullet)

#### Known issues

Due to the [identified bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1111723) with latest Chrome(version: 84.0.4147.105), Vaadin components with popup (like ComboBox, Select, DatePicker) may cause Chrome to freeze in layouts with several nested Divs.

# Getting Started with Vaadin
## App starters
The best way to get started with Vaadin is to go to [https://vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) and pick an app template for the technology stack you’re interested in. 

### Note
vaadin 17 starters are not available just yet in vaadin.com. You can use Vaadin 14 starter and manually change Vaadin version (see instructions below).

## Manually changing Vaadin version for Java projects

Add the following contents to your project pom.xml.
```
<dependencyManagement>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
        <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
        <version>{{platform}}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencyManagement>

# Known Issues and Limitations

This is the prerelease version of vaadin 17 for evaluating a number of new features and bug fixes. The API in this prerelease version is not considered final and may change based on user feedback.

## Flow
- The Template-in-Template feature has [some limitations](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atemplate-in-template+)
- Links matching the context do not result in browser page load by default, instead they are handled with application routing. To opt-out, set the `router-ignore` attribute on the anchor element. This opt-out is needed for cases when native browser navigation is necessary, e. g., when [using `Anchor` to link a `StreamResource` download](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/7623).

# Migrating from Vaadin 8

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
