# Getting Started with Vaadin

The best way to get started with Vaadin is to go to [https://vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) and pick an app template for the technology stack youâ€™re interested in. 

### Note

## Manually changing Vaadin version for Java projects

Add the following contents to your project pom.xml.
```
<dependencyManagement>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
        <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
        <version>{{platform}}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
    ...

# Known Issues and Limitations

This is the prerelease version of Vaadin 21 for evaluating a number of new features and bug fixes. The API in this prerelease version is not considered final and may change based on user feedback.

## Flow
- The Template-in-Template feature has [some limitations](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atemplate-in-template+)
- Links matching the context do not result in browser page load by default, instead they are handled with application routing. To opt-out, set the `router-ignore` attribute on the anchor element. This opt-out is needed for cases when native browser navigation is necessary, e. g., when [using `Anchor` to link a `StreamResource` download](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/7623).

# Migrating from Vaadin 8
See [the migration guide](https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/migration/1-migrating-v8-v10.html)

# Migrating from Vaadin 10-14
See [the migration guide](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/v14-migration/v14-migration-guide.html)

# Migrating from Vaadin 17
Update the Vaadin version in the build files, and check if the project is using any of the breaking changes mentioned in the 'New and Noteworthy' section above.
In addition, in the case of using the now deprecated PolymerTemplate in views, we encourage to migrate to LitTemplate.

# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) Bug tickets and enhancement requests that are specific to a certain Vaadin component should be posted in the component's Web Component repostory (e.g. https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button for Button).
2) Issues that are not component-specific (e.g. requests for new components) or encompass multiple components should be posted in [vaadin-flow-components](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-flow-components) repository. 
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
