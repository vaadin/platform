# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) Bug tickets and enhancement requests that are specific to a certain Vaadin component should be posted in the component's Web Component repostory (e.g. https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button for Button).
2) Issues that are not component-specific (e.g. requests for new components) or encompass multiple components should be posted in [vaadin-flow-components](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-flow-components) repository. 
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
