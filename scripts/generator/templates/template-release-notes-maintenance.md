# Reporting Issues
We appreciate if you try to find the most relevant repository to report the issue in. If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues.

A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:
1) If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button
2) If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow
3) If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is https://github.com/vaadin/flow
4) If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/designer
5) If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is https://github.com/vaadin/testbench
