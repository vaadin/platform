# Vaadin platform

[Vaadin platform](https://vaadin.com/) consists of a set of web components, a Java web framework called Vaadin Flow, configurable themes, tools and a set of opinionated app starters. Platform releases gather all products in to a single package every quarter. The product versions included in a platform release are not necessarily the latest released versions, but are hand picked so that they work well together.
